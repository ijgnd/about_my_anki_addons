#### about_my_anki_addons

- Use my add-ons at your own risk.
- I don't use all of the add-ons I've uploaded to Ankiweb (anymore). 
- I don't test all of my add-ons with each new Anki release.
- At the moment I mostly use the old anki version 2.1.35 because of some add-ons that are not adjusted to more recent versions. My add-ons are not well tested on newer  versions.
- When you find a bug in one of my add-ons let me know. on the ankiweb page for each add-on there's a button "contact author".
